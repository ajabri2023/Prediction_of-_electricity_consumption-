##################Prediction of monthly electricity consumption in France###################################

In our time, electricity constitutes the lifeblood of the majority of economic sectors and the daily life of households. It is the vector of evolution of contemporary civilization. As a result, the search for new sources of energy and the optimization of its consumption are the major challenges for public authorities and the various economic actors linked directly or indirectly with the energy market, especially with the risks induced by fluctuation. of the international energy market and ecological constraints (CO2 emissions, depletion of natural resources, etc.).
For these reasons, future forecasts of energy consumption play a vital role in decision-making mechanisms relating to the energy sector. Alongside the scientific and empirical methods used for future forecasts, we cannot neglect the role of artificial intelligence in this field, especially with the remarkable evolution of digital calculation systems (processors, etc.) at the software and hardware levels.
Our study will concern the use of artificial intelligence technology in the creation of a prediction model for future electricity consumption in France based on electricity consumption in past years.
The notebooks in this file describe the different stages of finding a solution. At the beginning we will do an analysis on existing datasets using the different Python libraries. Then, we will study the evolution of electricity consumption over time by visualizing it in the form of a curve and making it modelable (processing). Depending on the analysis and decomposition results, we will choose the appropriate prediction algorithm.

Geographical area concerned: France;

Prediction interval: from January 2023 to December 2031;

Predicted variables:

    -Corrected monthly electricity consumption;

    -Raw monthly electricity consumption;

Prediction model used: SARIMA.
